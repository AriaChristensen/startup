## Online Recipe Saver

Many people, myself included, grab a tasty-looking recipe from google when they want to make a certain dish. If it is good, they might try to find it again a few weeks later, to find that it is not in the same spot they originally found it, or they don't remember enough of how they found it the first time to find it again. This website will let people compile recipes they find online to a unique digital cookbook for easy access later.

This website will enable people to save URL's to other websites and organize them into different tabs for easy navigation. It will let them share recipes with others and import recipes others shared with them. You can rate each recipe and add comments of your own for next time, as well as pictures of your results. You will also be able to add ingredients from a recipe to a shopping list.

**Authentication --** Users will log in to their own cookbook so that they can upload their own files

**Database Data --** The database will store URL's, comments, and ratings for each recipe.

**Websocket Data --** The website will notify you anytime a recipe is shared with you.

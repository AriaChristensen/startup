# Notes

## Using Github
I still need to log in on VSCode, but I feel pretty proficient at using hte command line now.
Don't forget to push after you commit, or it won't actually show up.

My key is stored in ~/.ssh, as well as a handy shortcut (ssh webprog) that can be used in ubuntu.

## Managing Instance

Go to AWS console and make sure the instance is running, this allows entrance to the webpage. 
Don't terminate the instance or the webpage will not be accessible.


## HTML

Here is a link to my CodePen with some basic HTML commands: https://codepen.io/Aria-Christensen/pen/XWoEEwa.

HTML is used to provide structure and content. There is a <head></head> section that contains information about the site as a whole, and a <body></body> section that contains all the content for the page.

Here is a link to my CodePen with some syntax for using inputs: https://codepen.io/Aria-Christensen/pen/KKboGOY

Note that when you add things after an = sign, they need to be enclosed in "quotes".
